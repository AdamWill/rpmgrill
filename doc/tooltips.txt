# BEGIN RPM::Grill::Plugin::VirusCheck

|VirusCheck
|  This module runs clamav against files in an rpm. Silly as that may seem,
|  there may be customers who run clamav and may be concerned to see it trigger.
|  This module may help us avoid an embarrassment in the field.

ClamAV
  <p>The ClamAV "antivirus" tool has found something suspicious in
  your package. This is so unlikely, so rare, so exceptional, that
  it's gotta be worth looking into.</p>
  
  <p>FIXME</p>

# BEGIN RPM::Grill::Plugin::RpmMetadata

|RpmMetadata
|  This module examines the 'rpm -q' of RPMs in this build,
|  and gripes about various esoteric (potential) problems.

WrongName
  <p>Deprecated code; no longer used in production. This was a useless test.</p>

WrongVersion
  <p>Deprecated code; no longer used in production. This was a useless test.</p>

WrongRelease
  <p>Deprecated code; no longer used in production. This was a useless test.</p>

NoVendor
  <p>FIXME - can this happen?</p>

WrongVendor
  <p>The <b>Vendor</b> field in the RPM specfile is expected to be <code>Red Hat, Inc.</code>
  exactly like that, with the comma and the period.</p>
  
  <p>Yes, we know this is nitpicky.</p>

NoBuildHost
  <p>The <code>Build Host</code> field in the rpm metadata is empty. Can this happen?</p>

BadBuildHost
  <p>The <code>Build Host</code> field in the rpm metadata is expected to be a host
  in the <code>.redhat.com</code> domain.</p>

InvalidURL
  <p>The <code>URL</code> field in the rpm specfile is expected to be of the form
  <code>protocol://host...</code>. This code indicates that the URL does not
  conform to that requirement.</p>

UnknownProtocol
  <p>The <code>URL</code> field in the rpm specfile is expected to be of the form
  <code>protocol://host...</code>. This code indicates that <code>protocol</code> is not
  one that rpmgrill recognizes (http, https, ftp, git).</p>
  
  <p>This is probably OK. It probably just means that rpmgrill needs to
  be taught about a new protocol. But it could also be a typo.</p>

InvalidHostnameInURL
  <p>The hostname in the URL field contains no dots.</p>

BadURL
  <p>rpmgrill tried to do an HTTP GET on the URL, but it failed. Maybe the
  host is unreachable?</p>
  
  <p>FIXME: Every so often, for reasons I don't understand, it gets a
  timeout and reports a problem with a host that is clearly
  reachable. Suggestions welcome.</p>

NoSuchHost
  <p>The hostname in the rpm specfile URL does not resolve. This probably
  means your URL is invalid.</p>

WeirdHost
  <p>The hostname in the rpm specfile URL resolves externally (outside
  redhat.com) but not internally. This is weird. It is not expected
  to happen. If it does, Ed would love to hear about it.</p>

HostnameLeak
  <p>The hostname in the rpm specfile URL resolves inside redhat.com
  but not outside. This probably means that you're using an
  <b>internal-only host</b>. If this package has any external visibility,
  you may want to consider changing the URL.</p>
  
  <p>This test is a good candidate for a whitelist: some sort of
  small database indicating which packages (eg errata, rpmdiff)
  we should silently excuse.</p>

FedoraInSummary
  <p>The RPM Summary field mentions Fedora without a corresponding
  "or Red Hat". Please review the summary string and (1) change
  Fedora to Red Hat (making other changes as necessary); or (2) change
  it to read "Fedora or Red Hat". If you think this test is being
  too strict, please file a bug against Brewtap.</p>
  
  <p>See <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=802555">bz802555</a></p>

FedoraInDescription
  <p>The RPM Description field mentions Fedora without a corresponding
  "or Red Hat". Please review the description string and (1) change
  Fedora to Red Hat (making other changes as necessary); or (2) change
  it to read "Fedora or Red Hat". If you think this test is being
  too strict, please file a bug against Brewtap.</p>

# BEGIN RPM::Grill::Plugin::SpecFileSanity

|SpecFileSanity
|  * runs 'rpm -q' against specfile, for sanity check
|  * looks for commented-out macros (which don't do what you think)

CannotRunRpm
  <p>rpmgrill tries to run <code>rpm -q --specfile <i>path</i></code>. This error code
  indicates that there was a failure invoking the <code>rpm</code> command. There
  is no stderr available, so it's probably impossible to know what
  happened. If you're seeing this error, it means something very
  weird and unexpected has happened.</p>

BadExitStatusFromRpm
  <p>rpmgrill tries to run <code>rpm -q --specfile <i>path</i></code>. This error code
  indicates that there was a failure invoking the <code>rpm</code> command. There
  is no stderr available, but rpmgrill was able to get an exit code.
  If you're seeing this error, it means something very
  weird and unexpected has happened.</p>

RpmParseDependency
  <p>rpmgrill runs <code>rpm -q --specfile <i>path</i></code> and reports
  any problems it finds. This warning usually means that your specfile
  has a macro that invokes <i>ruby</i>, <i>python</i>, or some
  other tool which is not installed on this system. <b>I know</b>:
  you probably have that tool as a package dependency. But remember,
  this is the <b>specfile</b>. In the <b>SRPM</b>. People viewing
  the SRPM may not have all your prereqs installed.</p>

RpmParseWarnings
  <p>rpmgrill runs <code>rpm -q --specfile <i>path</i></code> and reports
  any problems it finds. Typical problems:</p>
  
  <pre>  sh: ...fg: no job control
    You probably have a stray % (percent sign) somewhere</pre>
  

RpmParseErrors
  <p>rpmgrill runs <code>rpm -q --specfile <i>path</i></code> and reports
  any problems it finds. This error means that the rpm command failed.
  This may affect someone who downloads your SRPM for viewing.</p>

MacroSurprise
  <p>Did you know that RPM expands macros even inside comments?</p>
  
  <p>Sometimes this is OK: %{name}, %{version}. But when %{foo} is
  a multi-line macro, this can cause unpleasant surprises.</p>
  
  <p><b>Recommendation</b>: Double-percent them all: %%{name}, etc.</p>

ChangelogMissing
  <p>There is no %changelog section in your specfile. Can this happen?</p>

ChangelogEmpty
  <p>The %changelog section in your specfile is empty. This error doesn't
  sound like it could happen, but it does.</p>

ChangelogOnlyNeedsVR
  <p>You included your package name in the %changelog entry. All you need
  is the Version-Release.
  See <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Changelogs">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Changelogs</a></p>

ChangelogCruftInVersion
  <p>The version string in your first %changelog entry includes unnecessary
  cruft.</p>

ChangelogWrongEpoch
  <p>You included an epoch in your %changelog entry, but it's the wrong one.</p>

ChangelogUnexpectedEpoch
  <p>You included an epoch in your %changelog entry, but the specfile itself
  does not define an Epoch.</p>

ChangelogBadVersion
  <p>The version string in your first %changelog entry does not match the
  one defined in the package specfile.</p>

ChangelogBadRelease
  <p>The release string in your first %changelog entry does not match the
  one defined in the package specfile.</p>

ChangelogWeirdLine
  <p>I could not parse the first line of the %changelog section in your specfile.
  See <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Changelogs">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Guidelines#Changelogs</a></p>

# BEGIN RPM::Grill::Plugin::SpecFileEncoding

|SpecFileEncoding
|  This module warns about non-UTF8 characters in the specfile.

NonUtf8
  <p>Packaging guidelines require that the rpm specfile be encoded in UTF-8.
  This message code indicates that your specfile includes characters
  that are not valid in UTF-8.</p>
  
  <p>FIXME: link to packaging guidelines</p>

# BEGIN RPM::Grill::Plugin::ElfChecks

|ElfChecks
|  This plugin contains two tests:
|  
|    RPATH - looks for suspicious directories in ELF RPATH
|  
|    RELRO - require security-enhanced compile options on certain executables.
|  
|  See http://post-office.corp.redhat.com/archives/os-devel-list/2011-July/msg00149.html

PiePartialRelro
  <p>FIXME</p>

PieNotRelro
  <p>File compiled with PIE but not RELRO.</p>

LibMissingRELRO
  <p>Library file not compiled with RELRO or PIE.</p>
  
  <p>FIXME: I don't remember why this is important.</p>

SetuidMissingRELRO
  <p>Setuid executable not compiled with RELRO.

  Note that we use heuristics to identify daemons, and these may result in
  false positives (we identify "foo" as a daemon but it really isn't) and
  false negatives (we fail to identify "bar" as a daemon, and don't check it for RELRO).</p>

SetuidPartialRELRO
  <p>Setuid executable compiled with only <i>partial</i> RELRO (RHEL6 requires <i>full</i>).
  See <a href="http://post-office.corp.redhat.com/archives/os-devel-list/2011-July/msg00149.html">http://post-office.corp.redhat.com/archives/os-devel-list/2011-July/msg00149.html</a>.</p>

# BEGIN RPM::Grill::Plugin::Patches

|Patches
|  This module checks for unapplied patches and for bad values of fuzz.

DuplicatePatch
  <p>Multiple definitions seen for <code>PatchNN</code>.
  This is often caused by a <code>%if</code> in the specfile, but
  it could also be an unintentional duplication.</p>

BadPatchFuzz
  <p>Overriding patch's fuzz factor is a bad idea. It means: "those
  three lines of context that diff provides? Toss some of those
  away, and try again". You can end up with code that compiles
  but is silently corrupt. There really is no reason for this.
  Why not take the time to regenerate your patches?
  See <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=692142">bz692142</a></p>

# BEGIN RPM::Grill::Plugin::Multilib

|Multilib
|  This module tests for multilib incompatibilities, i.e. conflicts that
|  will prevent 32- and 64-bit versions of a package from being installed
|  together.
|  
|  This may not be important for your package. Perhaps your package will
|  never be installed multilib. There is no mechanism for determining
|  that.

MultilibMismatch
  <p>The 64- and 32-bit versions of FILE differ. This means that yum/rpm
  will refuse to install both versions at once. Please don't blame
  rpmgrill for this: we're just reporting a potential problem. If this
  package will never ever ever be installed multilib, you can ignore
  this warning.</p>

# END   RPM::Grill::Plugin::Multilib
###############################################################################
# BEGIN RPM::Grill::Plugin::Manifest

|Manifest
|  This module runs a variety of tests on the RPM manifest, i.e.
|  the list of files shipped in an RPM.

UnownedDirectory
  <p>I'm not sure this is a real problem. Basically: your package claims
  ownership of the parent directory, and at least one subdirectory inside
  the complained-about directory, but not the complained-about directory
  itself. This may have to do with the rpm <code>%dir</code> directive. I need to
  learn more about packaging, and may remove this test if it's useless.
  If you're rpm-savvy, help would be appreciated.</p>

NonFHS
  <p>See <a href="http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Storage_Administration_Guide/s1-filesystem-fhs.html">http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Storage_Administration_Guide/s1-filesystem-fhs.html</a></p>

NonSystemdFile
  <p>See <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=802557">bz802557</a></p>

MoveToUsr
  <p>RHEL7 is doing away with <code>/usr</code>. Your package has one or more
  files that are still living there.
  See <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=802554">bz802554</a></p>

FedoraInFilename
  <p>Files containing <code>fedora</code> as part of the name might be inappropriate
  for RHEL. See <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=802555">bz802555</a></p>
  
  <p>(Note: As of April 2012 there are some known false positives here
  that should be whitelisted. Ed is trying to figure out a way to
  whitelist these).</p>

# BEGIN RPM::Grill::Plugin::RpmScripts

|RpmScripts
|  This module checks for problems in the rpm install scripts,
|  such as running 'useradd' with the wrong uid.

UseraddNoHomedir
  <p>Invocation of <code>useradd</code> without an explicit home directory.</p>

UseraddBadShell
  <p>Invocation of <code>useradd</code> with an unexpected login shell: the expectation
  is that shell will be <code>/sbin/nologin</code></p>

UseraddNoShell
  <p>Invocation of <code>useradd</code> without a -s/--shell option. This is probably bad.</p>

UseraddWrongUid
  <p>Invocation of <code>useradd</code> with the wrong numeric UID for an account.
  This error means that there <b>is</b> a UID defined for the user in
  the <b>setup</b> package. You should be using that UID.</p>

UseraddUnknownUid
  <p>Blah blah FIXME</p>

UseraddCheckUid
  <p>This is a case that rpmgrill can't realistically verify on its own, because
  rpm macros and/or shell environment variables may not expand the same way
  in the rpmgrill environment as they do in real life.</p>

UseraddNoUid
  <p>Invoking <code>useradd</code> without an explicit UID.</p>

GroupaddWrongGid
  
GroupaddCheckGid
  <p>This is a case that rpmgrill can't realistically verify on its own, because
  rpm macros and/or shell environment variables may not expand the same way
  in the rpmgrill environment as they do in real life.</p>

FedoraUserMgmt
  <p>Your package is using fedora-useradd and/or fedora-groupadd, from
  the fedora-usermgmt package. Since we're in RedHatLand, not
  FedoraLand, you should be using just plain useradd/groupadd.</p>

# BEGIN RPM::Grill::Plugin::Setxid

|Setxid
|  This plugin warns about setxid (setuid, setgid) files not on the
|  authorized whitelist. The whitelist is currently (2012-05-08)
|  maintained by Josh Bressers.

SetuidDirectory
  <p>There is no reason to have a Setuid directory. Perhaps you meant to
  make it set<b>g</b>id (group)?</p>

UnauthorizedSetxid
  <p>All setgid directories and setuid/setgid files must be enumerated in
  a <a href="https://FIXME.redhat.com/FIXME">whitelist</a>. sdfdsf</p>

WrongFileMode
  <p>rpmgrill found a setuid/setgid file which is whitelisted, but
  the file <b>permissions don't match</b> what's specified in the whitelist.</p>

WrongFileUser
  <p>rpmgrill found a setuid/setgid file which is whitelisted, but
  the file <b>owner doesn't match</b> the one specified in the whitelist.</p>

WrongFileGroup
  <p>rpmgrill found a setuid/setgid file which is whitelisted, but

# BEGIN RPM::Grill::Plugin::BuildLog

|BuildLog
|  This module scans the build logs (all arches), looking for
|  and griping about common warnings. These are warnings that
|  may still result in a successful build but which could result
|  in broken or insecure executables.

MacroExpansion
  <p>FIXME</p>

BufferOverflow
  <p>FIXME</p>

TypePun
  <p>I have no idea, but rpmdiff runs this check and apparently it's a
  good thing to fix. This probably needs to be fixed upstream.</p>

IntegerOverflow
  <p>FIXME</p>

BrokenMemset
  <p>FIXME</p>

PatchApply
  <p>FIXME</p>

MakeError
  <p>Possible error trapped by 'make'. This indicates the presence of
  <code>make [...] Error</code> somewhere in the log.</p>

MiscBuildError
  <p>Possible error in the build log. This indicates the presence of
  <code>failed with exit status:</code> somewhere in the log.</p>

# BEGIN RPM::Grill::Plugin::DesktopLint

|DesktopLint
|  This module checks for common problems in .desktop files. We run
|  the RHEL 'desktop-file-validate' program, and also run consistency
|  checks of our own on the Exec and Icon lines.

DesktopFileValidation
  <p>rpmgrill invokes <code>desktop-file-validate</code> on .desktop files.
  This is the output from that command.</p>

DesktopExecFileMissing
  <p>Your .desktop file includes <code>Exec=<i>foo</i></code>, but
  there's no /usr/bin/<i>foo</i> in this package or any of its subpackages.
  This probably means that <i>foo</i> is provided by a dependency.</p>

DesktopExecMissingReq
  <p>Your .desktop file uses htmlview or xdg-open, but your specfile
  does not have a matching <code>Require:</code> line for that tool.</p>

DesktopIconFileMissing
  <p>Your .desktop file specifies an icon which is not present in this package.</p>
  
  <p>FIXME: this is probably a false alarm, because the icon may be in
  another package. But there's not really any way for Brewtap to
  know or test that. Should we just remove this test?</p>
